# Respiros

Here's the pcb for respiros ventilator. It's designed as a shield for raspberry pi.

Important: due to the high current consumption of the servo, raspberry should be powered trought the shield and not from its own power connector.

Thanks to Nils for the raspberry template https://github.com/NilsMinor/Raspberry-Pi-3-Altium-Template
